## Included Modules

### `Airplane_Speed.m`
- Calculates true airspeed based on altitude, temperature, and pressure
- Integrates atmospheric conditions with aircraft performance analysis

###  `Atmosphere_Modeling.m`
- Implements the **International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model**
- Computes pressure, temperature, and density variations with altitude

### `Humidity.m`
- Models relative humidity and its effect on atmospheric properties
- Useful for thermodynamic assessments and real-weather corrections

### `Ratio.m`
- Computes key atmospheric ratios (e.g., temperature, pressure, density ratios)
- Supports standard and non-standard day comparisons

### `Temprature_Variation.m`
- Models temperature gradients with altitude
- Supports custom lapse rates for different atmospheric layers
